    <p>I&rsquo;m a lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. My area of specialty is Kant and early modern philosophy, though I have further interests and teaching experience in ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and aesthetics. I earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Indiana University in September 2017. I wrote my dissertation entitled “Kant’s Theoretical Conception of God” under the direction of Allen Wood.</p>

        <p>The goal of this project is to develop a Kantian account of political emotions. The project combines two growingly prolific research agendas. The first is a reappreciation of the role emotions play in Kant’s broader philosophical framework. The second focuses on the emotions involved in political life. I propose that the integration of these two areas of study enriches both of them. First, the project aims to uncover the social and political aspect of many of the emotions accounted in Kant’s philosophy, which have often been overlooked in the existing scholarship. Secondly, we propose that a Kantian perspective on political emotions will make a valuable contribution to contemporary debates by articulating a novel relation between emotions, reasoning and collective psychology. The upshot of the proposed account is that Kantian political emotions are embedded in the values and normativity essential for finding orientation in political life. 
According to a common caricature, Kant’s practical philosophy emphasizes reason above all else and is therefore severely strict and cold-hearted. Emotions and feelings are seen as hinderances to rationality or at best as irrelevant. In recent years this simplistic picture faded as new scholarship evolved to examine the wealth of Kantian texts on moral psychology and anthropology dealing with a variety of emotions and resulting in illuminating accounts of the nature of emotions and their tight relation to practical reasoning. These works reveal a more nuanced account of the interdependence between emotions and rationality. Yet most of the resulting accounts focus on the personal aspect of emotional responses and moral deliberation. The social and political aspects of Kant’s account of emotions are yet to be fully appreciated in a systematic way. We suggest that the Kantian account has the resources to articulate collective emotions as responsive to the emotions, intentions and states of other members of society. A somewhat similar trend emerged in political thought, also in the kind of liberal theory inspired by Kant. On the surface, liberal political theory aims to seek rational solutions to collective problems and emotions are often regarded as harming public discourse by inviting intractable conflicts. However, more recent political thought has begun to acknowledge the positive role emotions play in motivating social movements, sustaining liberal democratic institutions and preventing their erosion. These parallel trends in Kantian ethics and political theory show that the Kantian framework can be particularly suitable to investigate the notion of political emotions and their function in public life. 
The project is divided into the following three sub-projects. In the first I will develop accounts of political guise of the various emotional attitudes discussed by Kant, positive and negative, such as hope, respect, disinterested pleasure, guilt, envy, fear and love. In the second sub-project I will build upon these analyses to construct a systematic Kantian theory of political emotions. Finally, in the third subproject, I will apply my account to contemporary debates on political emotions, such as those concerning polarization, populism, and democratic resilience.</p>

<li>&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s Regulative Metaphysics&rdquo; (ISF 2907/21)

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>The goal of this project is to develop an interpretation of Kant’s doctrine of regulative ideas as an account about the meaningfulness of certain metaphysical theories. The upshot of the proposed account is that certain metaphysical theories are meaningful not because they express beliefs about determinate facts, but rather because they express rational norms of how we ought to explain reality. I label this account Regulative Metaphysics. The project has both an exegetical objective in uncovering overlooked aspects in Kant’s doctrine of regulative ideas, as well as a philosophical objective in presenting a novel way to assess contemporary debates in metaphysics. 
Kant claims that human reason has an interest in ultimate explanations and possesses regulative principles directing progress towards such explanations. In his criticism of rationalistic metaphysics, Kant contends that these interests result in the illusory pretensions to attain knowledge of God, the world-whole and the soul. But those entities are appropriated to receive a new role as regulative ideas of reason. The role of the regulative principles of reason for scientific inquiry has been discussed in great lengths in the literature. But the relation between the regulative principles of reason and the specific metaphysical content of the ideas of reason is yet to be fully appreciated. In this project I aim to show that understanding this relation is central for a comprehensive explication of the doctrine of the regulative use of reason and for Kant’s view on metaphysics in general. The central claim is that those metaphysical conceptions are meaningful in virtue of their being an expression of the regulative principles. Therefore, the metaphysical content has a bearing on the correct interpretation of the principles.
The project is divided into the following three sub-projects. In the first I will develop the account of regulative metaphysics from Kant’s doctrine of the ideas of reason. This includes both an exegetical thesis about the roots of the doctrine in the pre-critical period, as well as a reconstruction of the expressive nature of the use of regulative ideas in Kant’s critical works. In the second I will use this account to interpret other metaphysical issues in Kant’s later works, mainly in the philosophy of natural science and practical philosophy. In the third subproject I will apply my account to contemporary debates in analytic metaphysics related to truthmaking, grounding, and fundamentality, showing how controversies express differences in explanation norms. 
The main methodology of this project is a combination of historical contextualization and systematic reconstruction of the relevant historical texts. Additionally, parts of this project will make use of digital humanities methodologies and will involve developing tools for visualizations of cross references in the corpus and analysis of historical trends in Kant scholarship.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>Kant maintains that particular laws of nature are discovered empirically yet are taken to be necessary. This raises the question of how to account for their necessity. Two leading interpretations emerged: the best system account (BSA) and the necessitation account (NA). BSA provides a methodological-epistemological account for the regularities that can be justifiably considered as laws of nature. On the other hand, NA provides an account of what it is to be a law of nature in terms of metaphysical explanatory grounds. While the interpretations are different in nature, there is textual evidence in Kant for both. In this paper, I aim to explain the duality of the interpretations and reconcile them. I present how they are intertwined in Kant’s works, first by pointing out the metaphysical content of the idea of God which grounds the unity and necessity of the laws of nature. Secondly, I argue that both accounts share an epistemic status as regulative ideas which I interpret as expressing rational norms of scientific inquiry. Thus, Kant maintains that scientific inquiry encompasses a single norm of explanation in which the systematicity and necessity of the laws of nature are interdependent. This norm is expressed in metaphysical concepts such as essences, powers, and most importantly the regulative idea of God. Finally, I consider the relevance of this unified account to contemporary debates about the laws of nature by suggesting that the Kantian regulative framework could explain and deflate questionable ontological commitments by identifying metaphysical terms as expressions of norms.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>Both in the appendix to the dialectic of the Critique of Pure Reason and in the introduction of the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant maintains that scientific knowledge requires a principle of systematicity. In the first case, the principle of systematicity is anchored in the faculty of reason with its regulative principles. In the second, it is the power of judgment in its reflective use. Yet Kant does not give an account of the duplicity of explanations or the relation between them. What is the meaning of transferring the principle from reason to the power of judgment? Most of the literature deals with the different arguments establishing the necessity of the principle. In this paper, however, I give attention to the change in the faculty responsible for the principle. I argue that the third Critique supplements the doctrine of the regulative ideas of reason of the first Critique in that it expresses the same principle of systematicity in the form of the act of reflective judgment. Thus, the principle of systematicity is a subjectively necessary demand of finding the world amenable to our cognitive ends. It is expressed both in reason’s idea of maximal systematicity and the act or reflective judgment.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>Should we take seriously Kant’s claim that his critical philosophy is the ‘true apology for Leibniz’? By exploring Kant’s attitude towards Leibniz’s doctrine of pre-established harmony, I argue that we should take it seriously because it sheds light on the development of Kant’s view about the role of teleology in science in general and in the life sciences in particular. I first present the general framework through which Kant appropriates Leibnizian doctrines as regulative ideals.  I then address Kant’s pre-critical engagement with pre-established harmony. While he rejected it as an account of causal relations between substances, he made extensive references to harmony between laws of nature. I argue that the critical development of this type of harmony allows Kant to appreciate one of Leibniz’s motivations in arguing for pre-established harmony, the compatibility of mechanistic and teleological causal laws. Finally, I show how this affinity becomes explicit in the Critique of the Power of Judgment in Kant’s novel position on the legitimacy of teleological explanations of organisms. I demonstrate this by pointing to Kant’s complex attitude towards 18th century theories of epigenesis.</p>

        <p>In his lectures on Logic and Metaphysics Kant distinguishes between logical and real essences. While the former are related to concepts and are knowable, the latter are related to things and are unknowable. In this paper, I argue that the unknowability is explained by the modal characteristic of real essences as a necessitating ground of which a priori knowledge is impossible. I also show how this claim is related to the unknowable necessity of particular laws of nature. Since laws of nature are conceived as grounded in real essences, the unknowability of the latter is equivalent to Kant’s other claim that there can be no knowledge of the necessity of particular laws of nature. Necessity can only be known a priori, and therefore, the necessity of particular laws is only assumed and conceived as grounded in something unknowable, a real essence. This conclusion will allow me to attribute to Kant a position I label as ‘regulative essentialism’, meaning that real essences have an indispensable role of in accordance with the rational interest to explain nature as a system of laws and natural kinds, combined with an epistemic humility about the correspondence of our empirical concepts to real essences.</p>

        <p>In his 1785 book Morning hours, Moses Mendelssohn presents a proof for the existence of God from the grounding of possibility. Although Mendelssohn claims that this proof is original, it has not received much attention in the secondary literature. In this paper, I will analyze this proof and present its historical context. I will show that although it resembles Leibniz’s proof from eternal truths and Kant’s pre-critical possibility proof, it has unique characteristics which can be regarded as responses to deficiencies Mendelssohn identified in these earlier proofs. I argue that by analyzing the semantics of judgments about dispositions, Mendelssohn provides a novel explanation for the basic premise shared by these proofs, namely that possibility is grounded in actuality. Additionally, this analysis simplifies the inference to a unique infinite mind grounding all possibility. Thus, the proof is worth studying both for historical reasons and for its original account of modal concepts.</p>

        <p>The nature of Kant’s criticism of his pre-Critical ‘possibility proof’ for the existence of God, implicit in the account of the Transcendental Ideal in the Critique of Pure Reason, is still under dispute. Two issues are at stake: the error in the proof and diagnosis of the reason for committing it. I offer a new way to connect these issues. In contrast with accounts that locate the motivation for the error in reason’s interest in an unconditioned causal ground of all contingent existence, I argue that it lies in reason’s interest in another kind of unconditioned ground, collective unity. Unlike the conception of the former, that of the latter directly explains the problematic ontological assumption of the possibility proof, the existence of intelligible objects as the ground of possibility. I argue that such Platonic entities are assumed because they are amenable to the kind of unity prescribed by reason. However, since the interest in collective unity has a legitimate regulative use when applied to the systematic unity of nature, the conception of God entailed by the possibility proof is retained as a regulative idea of reason.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>In the “Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic” of the Critique of Pure 
Reason, Kant contends that the idea of God has a positive regulative role in the 
systematization of empirical knowledge. But why is this regulative role assigned to 
this specific idea? Kant’s account is rather opaque, and this question has also not 
received much attention in the literature. In this article, I argue that an adequate 
understanding of the regulative role of the idea of God depends on the specific 
metaphysical content Kant attributes to it in the Critique and other writings. I 
show that neither a heuristic principle of conceptual systematicity, nor conceiving 
God as a hypothesis of an intelligent designer, can satisfy the demands of reason 
to make the unity and necessity of the laws of nature intelligible. Regarding the 
positive account about the metaphysical content of the idea of God, I support 
my argument by referring to Kant’s pre-critical discussion of the usefulness of the 
conception of God for the project of science, and by expounding Kant’s critical 
account of the necessity of the laws of nature. Thus, my account sheds light on the 
continuity of Kant’s conception of God and his appropriation of his own rationalistic metaphysics.</p>

        <p>Andrew Chignell and Omri Boehm have recently argued that Kant’s
pre-Critical proof for the existence of God entails a Spinozistic conception
of God and hence substance monism. The basis for this reading is the
assumption common in the literature that God grounds possibilities by
exemplifying them. In this article I take issue with this assumption
and argue for an alternative Leibnizian reading, according to which
possibilities are grounded in essences united in God’s mind (later also
described as Platonic ideas intuited by God). I show that this view about
the distinction between God’s cognition of essences as the ground of
possibility and the actual world is not only explicitly stated by Kant, but is
also consistent with his metaphysical picture of teleology in nature and
causality during the pre-Critical period. Finally, I suggest that the
distinction between the conceptual order of essences embodied in the idea
of God and the order of the objects of experience plays a role in the
transition into the Critical system, where it is transformed into the
distinction between the intelligible and the sensible worlds.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>​My dissertation argues for the conceptual unity and historical continuity of Kant’s theoretical conception of God. It shows both the importance of the conception of God for understanding the development of Kant’s thought from the pre-critical onto the critical philosophy, and its significant role in the Kantian account of theoretical rationality. I maintain that there is a single idea that guided Kant in construing the metaphysical conception of God traceable early on from the pre-critical philosophy, that of grounding the unity and necessity of the laws of nature. I examine how Kant’s critical adaptation of this prevalent early modern rationalistic position enables him to transform the conception of God from an object of metaphysical inquiry into a regulative idea of reason.  My interpretation thus explains the connection, mostly ignored in the literature, between the rationalist metaphysical conception of God and the regulative role it affords in the critical system.</p>

        <p>​Extending my work on Kant’s philosophy of religion, I am planning to work on the following papers. One is a paper about the role of God in the Critique of the Power of Judgment. I explain why the faculty of reflective judgment is introduced as an addition to the faculty of reason by relating it to the notion of God as an intuitive intellect. A second paper is about the relation between Kant’s moral and theoretical conceptions of God. While acknowledging Kant’s repeated claims about the superiority of the moral conception over the theoretical one, I argue that the latter informs in a significant way the former regarding its content and its epistemic status.</p>
<p>In addition to Kant, I am interested in working on less-researched figures in late 18th and early 19th century German philosophy. One article under review is about Moses Mendelssohn’s proof for the existence of God in the Morning Hours (see above). In another paper, I plan to explore the theological position of Lessing’s Christianity of Reason and Mendelssohn’s charitable appropriation of it in the Morning Hours. I suggest that these texts present an interesting theological alternative vis-à-vis Kant on the one hand and rationalism on the other hand.</p>

    <div class="expand-content" style="display: none;">
        <p>In one project inspired by Kant’s account of hope, I wish to investigate the role of hope in political activism. While there is a growing body of philosophical literature exploring the nature of hope, an account of the social-political dimensions of hope is still lacking. I suggest that hope figures not only in the attitudes of individuals involved in political activity, but that it is also required for characterizing the collective nature of activism and its ends. A standard account of hope analyzes it to include the belief that a desired outcome is possible though not certain. While hope does not depend on a judgment of probability, it can be responsive to evidence, increasing in light of ‘signs for hope’. Thus by utilizing Kant’s account of reflective judgment, I maintain that hope also involves a second-order disposition to look for and be receptive to such signs. Therefore, I augment the account of hope with a collective element which is the act of creating signs of hope in the public sphere. In the context of political action, this means creating signs for the possibility of social change. Taking a cue from Kant’s principle of the purposiveness of nature, I suggest transposing it to signs of hope in the social realm in the following ways. One type of sign is the formation of solidarity between disadvantaged groups which have seemingly unrelated interests. That would be a sign that a shared vision of justice is realizable through collective political action. A second type is the emergence of internal organization, for example in unionization or local grassroots campaigns. In addition to the immediate causes, such activities are signs for the very possibility of collective political agency. Thus the outcomes of solidarity and agency are valued not only instrumentally for specific policy changes but also because they foster in the agents of change and their intended audience the hope that political action can make a difference.</p>

        <p>Using my 15 years of experience in software engineering  I started to develop new research projects in Digital Humanities.</p>
<p><strong>Data visualization and research tools:</strong> My extensive use of the online version of Kant’s gesammelte Schriften archive led me to design various tools to improve its functionality. For example, I plan to build a database of Kant&rsquo;s handwritten notes (Reflexionen) adding visualizations of date ranges and cross-references to the location of the notes inside the books Kant owned (for example Baumgarten’s Metaphysics). I intend to make the tool publicly available through a web interface.</p>
<p><strong>Historical research using computational methods:</strong> A planned project applies the categorization of the PhilPapers database with textual topic modeling to analyze historical trends in Kant and early modern scholarship. By tracking the evolution of topics and their fluctuating significance over time in journal articles, I will be able to assess presumed trends, for example the rise of metaphysical readings of transcendental idealism, Kant’s philosophy of empirical sciences and his social-political philosophy.</p>
